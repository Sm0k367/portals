        <h1>General Instructions for EpicTech Portals</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to EpicTech Portals! This document provides general instructions to help you get started and navigate our interactive AI experiences. Specific portals may have their own detailed guides, which will be linked from their respective interfaces.</p>

        <h2>1. Navigating the Portals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Click to Advance:</strong> Many of our narrative-based portals allow you to progress through the story by simply clicking anywhere on the screen. Look for prompts like "Click anywhere to continue" or "Click to turn the page."</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Elements:</strong> Some portals feature clickable elements, buttons, or input fields. Hover over elements to see if they are interactive, or follow on-screen prompts.</li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard Controls:</strong> Certain portals may support keyboard shortcuts for navigation (e.g., arrow keys for movement, Enter for selection). Refer to the specific portal's instructions for details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Audio and Narration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Toggle Buttons:</strong> Most interactive story portals will have dedicated buttons (often in the top corners) to toggle background music and narration on or off. Look for icons like a music note (&#127925;) or a microphone (&#127897;&#65039;).</li>
            <li><strong>Volume Control:</strong> Adjust your device's volume to control the audio output.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Customization and Settings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Settings Menu:</strong> Some portals may include a settings menu (often represented by a gear icon &#9881;&#65039;) where you can adjust preferences such as text size, display options, or sound levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Saving Progress:</strong> For longer experiences, portals may automatically save your progress or offer a manual save option. Check the portal's interface for indicators.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Page Not Advancing:</strong> If a page is stuck, ensure you have clicked on the main content area. Sometimes, specific interactive elements need to be engaged first.</li>
            <li><strong>No Audio:</strong> Check your device's volume, ensure the in-portal audio toggles are on, and try refreshing the page.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Issues:</strong> If the portal runs slowly, try closing other browser tabs or applications. Ensure your browser is up to date.</li>
            <li><strong>Browser Compatibility:</strong> Our portals are designed for modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Ensure you are using a supported browser.</li>
        </ul>
